# Phaser3CMD
Phaser 3 examples for Programming for RealTime CMD Hanzehogeschool.

In this repository you will find some examples of using Phaser 3

THe examples build, as much as possible, upon content from earlier classes. Where possible new topics were moslty avoided if the thing to explain could be done using prior knowledge. This means there are other, and according to some arguably better, ways to achieve everything listed here. But this is what it is for now.

Although these examples may be referred to in class, it is a project maintained by me but paid for by no one. Requests for extra examples may therefor be denied based on time available...

If you want to post a request or find a bug, please use the Issues feature to notify me.
