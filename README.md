# Phaser3CMD
Phaser 3 examples for Programming for RealTime CMD Hanzehogeschool.

In this repository you will find some examples of using Phaser 3

Although these examples may be referred to in class, it is a project maintained by me but paid for by no one. Requests for extra examples may therefor be denied based on time available...

If you want to post a request or find a bug, please use the Issues feature to notify me.
