Phaser typescript template

Youâ€™ll need to follow a few steps before you can run the phaser game and start working on it.

## 1. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

## 2. Install dependencies

Run command (in command prompt or vscode terminal) inside the project folder:

```npm install```

## 3. Run the development server command.

Run:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.
This will also automaticly open your browser with a new tab at localhost:3000. If it doesn't you'll need to open it yourself and insert localhost:3000 into the address bar.
Lastly, this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser.
